This is an example of RS232 Serial Port Communications using VS2015 and Delegates along
with Global Variables for Communication.

Offers the user a list of Com Ports available on the computer to choose from and a list 
of Baud Rates to choose from.

Once selected communication is then established via the Connect Button.

This example written for the Yaesu FTDX5000, FTDX1200, FT991A, or FTDX10 just as a 
skeletal framework.

This was written to alleviate using the old Visual Basic 6 com control to achieve the 
ON COMM function in Visual Studio 2015 using vb 2015.
